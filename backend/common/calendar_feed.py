"""The iCalendar (RFC 5545) writer behind the per-user task feed (G14).

Hand-written because the output is small and fixed: one VCALENDAR of all-day
VEVENTs. No third-party library is installed for it and none is wanted.

This module imports nothing from Django's model layer, so
``common.public_tokens`` (the log and Sentry scrubber for the feed URL, whose
token is the whole credential) can import it while settings are still loading.

What an event carries is an owner decision, not a formatting choice: the task's
title and priority and a link back into the app, nothing else. No notes, and no
contact, account or other record names, because a subscribed calendar is read by
a third-party service (Google, Microsoft, Apple) on the user's behalf.
