"""Rate limits for the anonymous sign-in request endpoints, and the mixin every
view pairing a per-client throttle with a shared one uses.

`MagicLinkRequestView` and `PortalLoginRequestView` each mint a token and send
an email for a caller nobody has authenticated. Their own per-recipient check
(5 an hour per email or contact) caps what one inbox receives but not what one
caller sends: a fresh address is a fresh bucket. These layers sit in front of
it:

- Per client, bucketed on `common.request_meta.client_ip`. Both web pages call
  the API from the SvelteKit server, so every web visitor shares that server's
  bucket unless it sends their address signed with `RELAY_SECRET`. The default
  rates leave room for that, and `.env.example` says so.
- `MagicLinkGlobalThrottle`, across every caller. The magic link mails any
  address (sign-in also registers), so this is the backstop for a sender spread
  over many addresses.
- `PortalLoginOrgThrottle`, per org. The portal only mails an existing contact
  of that org, so the per-org cap is the useful backstop there.

All of them need the shared cache `crm/settings.py` builds from `CACHE_URL`.
