/**
 * Parent and child tickets on a ticket's page (PARITY B3).
 *
 * The phone has had this on `ticket_detail_screen.dart` all along: a parent
 * row, the tree the ticket sits in, link under a parent, detach. The web had
 * two components for it that nothing imported. This module is the part of the
 * web version that is not markup, so it can be tested on its own, the way
 * `close.js` is.
 *
 * Everything the page decides here comes from the API:
 *
 * - The tree is `GET /cases/<id>/tree/`, which starts at the TOP of the tree,
 *   not at this ticket, and names `focus_id`. A node the viewer may not open
 *   arrives redacted (`name: null`, `restricted: true`) and stays in place, so
 *   a readable grandchild under it keeps its real depth.
 * - Whether link and detach are offered is `comment_permission` from the
 *   detail payload, the ticket's write rule, which is the rule `link/` takes.
 * - What may be picked as a parent is the list endpoint's answer, which is
 *   already only tickets this person may open.
