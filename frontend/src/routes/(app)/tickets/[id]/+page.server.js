/**
 * The ticket, plus what closing it would take with it.
 *
 * The tree is fetched ONLY for a ticket in one (it has a parent or children),
 * and the org settings only for one with children, which is the only case a
 * close can cascade. Most tickets are in no tree, and extra requests on every
 * ticket open to answer a question that cannot arise are a cost paid for
 * nothing.
 *
 * Neither extra is allowed to break the page: a ticket that will not render
 * because its tree call failed is a worse outcome than a close button that
 * falls back to the plain one. Both fall back quietly, and the close action
 * re-derives everything server-side anyway, so nothing here is trusted.
 *
 * The time entries ride along in the same wave. They are their own request,
 * the ticket envelope carries only the `time_summary` totals, and they are
 * allowed to fail: a ticket that will not render because the time panel could
 * not load is the same bad trade as the tree below. `null` means the fetch
 * failed and the panel says so; `[]` means nobody has logged anything.
 *
 * The ticket's approval requests come in the same wave and may fail the same
 * way (`null`, and the panel says so). The detail's `approvalRule` says
 * whether any rule gates closing it at all.
 *
 * Watch state (`watchers/`, which answers `is_current_user_watching`) rides
 * in the first wave. The composer's saved replies and the article
 * candidates are fetched only for someone who may reply, the rule that also
 * gates sending and linking; `?aq=` searches the candidates. All three may
 * fail without breaking the page.
 *
 * `?merge=1` opens the "Merge into..." picker and `&q=` searches it. The
 * access token is an httpOnly cookie, so the search is a GET that reloads
 * this page rather than a browser fetch, and the candidates come only from
 * `merge-targets/`. They are fetched only when the picker is open and the
 * API says this person may merge the ticket.
 *
 * `?link=1` (with `&lq=`) is the same arrangement for "Link under a parent":
 * candidates from the ticket list, which holds only tickets this person may
 * open, fetched only when the API says they may change this ticket
 * (`comment_permission`, the write rule `link/` takes).
