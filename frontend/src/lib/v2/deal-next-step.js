/**
 * A deal's next open task as a phrase for the pipeline card and list row, or
 * `null` to show nothing.
 *
 * Only a deal in an open stage is flagged: a won or lost deal has no next step
 * to take, so it shows nothing, whether or not a task is still open on it. The
 * decision reads `stage_kind`, which the API derives from the deal's own
 * pipeline stage, never the stage code, because an admin can call a won stage
 * anything. `next_activity` is `null` when the viewer has no open task on the
 * deal (the API counts only tasks they can open), which is the flag, and
 * `undefined` when the response did not compute it, which is not.
 *
 * @param {{ stage_kind?: string | null, next_activity?: any }} deal
 * @param {Date} [now]
 * @returns {{ text: string, late: boolean } | null}
